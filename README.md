# My Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations from Scratch

## Project Goal

Welcome to my journey of diving deep into the world of machine learning algorithms! This repository is dedicated to my implementations of fundamental ML algorithms from scratch using Python. 

**Why From Scratch?**

Building algorithms from the ground up offers invaluable insights into their inner workings, mathematical foundations, and the impact of different design choices. This deep understanding forms a solid base for tackling more complex ML challenges and developing innovative solutions.

## Target Audience

This repository is ideal for:

* **Aspiring data scientists and ML enthusiasts:**  If you're starting your ML journey and want to move beyond using libraries by understanding the "how" and "why" behind the algorithms, you're in the right place!
* **Anyone seeking to solidify their ML foundations:**  Even if you have experience with ML libraries, implementing algorithms from scratch can significantly deepen your understanding.

## Prerequisites

* **Solid Python Fundamentals:** You should be comfortable with Python syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.), loops, functions, and basic file handling.
* **Basic Linear Algebra:** Familiarity with vectors, matrices, and basic operations (dot product, matrix multiplication) will be very helpful.
* **Enthusiasm for Learning:** The most important prerequisite! Be prepared to dive into mathematical concepts and problem-solving.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by algorithm. Each algorithm typically includes:

* **A detailed README.md:** Provides a clear explanation of the algorithm, its applications, mathematical background, and implementation details.
* **Python Code:** Well-commented code demonstrating the algorithm's implementation from scratch.
* **Data and Examples:** Datasets used for testing and illustration, along with examples of how to use the implemented algorithm.

## Current Implementations

* **Linear Regression:** [Link to your Linear Regression README.md]
    * Gradient Descent implementation (iterative and vectorized).
    * Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
    * Data preprocessing techniques (Min-Max Scaling, Standardization).
    * Comparison with the Normal Equation.

## Future Implementations (Roadmap)

* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
* **Neural Networks (from basic perceptrons to multi-layer architectures)**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**
* **Decision Trees (and potentially ensemble methods like Random Forests)**
* **Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.)**
